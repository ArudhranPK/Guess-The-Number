# Guess-The-Number
The computer will generate a four digit number and we have to find the number within sic chances given to the user.

I used randon module to generate a four digit number.

Strike means one of the four digit numbers from the user is correct and in right position.

Spare means one of the four digit numbers from the user is correct but in different position.

I hope you love this game.

And I'm planning to mae the reverse of this. Making the computer to find the four digit number.
